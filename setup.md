## How to run the Jupyter Notebooks with the virtual environment (venv)

1. **Create a virtual environment** (if not already created):

   ```bash
   # Already done, no need to run this again
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     # Only need to do run this on the new terminal
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
